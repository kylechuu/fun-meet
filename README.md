# Hello World Dating App KMP
## Overview:
  This project is a Hello World application built using Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP), designed as a warm-up exercise for a future dating app.
  The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate how Kotlin Multiplatform can be used to build cross-platform apps with shared business
  logic for both Android and iOS.
## Features:
  - Shared business logic between Android and iOS.
  - Basic UI using Kotlin Multiplatform for Android (using Jetpack Compose) and iOS.
  - Cross-platform codebase structure with platform-specific implementations where necessary.
## Comment:
  The Hello World app serves as the foundation for the larger dating app project, where more advanced features
  such as user authentication, profile management, and messaging will be added.
